# About
Welcome to Traffic is Bad!

Just in case you were not aware, traffic is bad, and driving in the United States can be very dangerous. We wanted to visualize the most dangerous counties in the US to help drivers learn which locations are less safe and what factors caused these incidents.

Before running our application, you must, as of now, set up a locally hosted website through Visual Studio (or another comparable program). We hope to remove this limitation in future developments.

# Information
- This application provides various information related to car crashes in the mainland United States during 2022.
- Hover over a county to see details regarding the car crashes that occurred in that county.
- Click on a county to zoom and use the colors to differentiate frequency. The darker colors correspond to greater frequencies/averages.
- Use the buttons on the right to change the filter of the data (average severity is the default).
- To select the data structure to contstuct the map, you must manually run the corresponding .exe from the build folder and refresh.
- The execution time measures the total amount of time taken to build this iteration. Notice the differences based on structure.

# Future Plans
- Make the application work under one button click.
- Better integrate the C++ code with the JavaScript.
- Add functionality to switch data structures within the UI.
- Allow user to regenerate the map using the current structure to recalculate the clock times.
- Increase data points from 1.7 million (only data from 2022) to include the full 7.7 million (2016 - Mar. 2023).
